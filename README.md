# Ultrasonic_processing
These MATLAB codes are used to pick the first peaks of the ultrasonic waves from the dynamic test and then write the data to the corresponding static tri-axial compression test.
1. ult_bigGCTS.m is the function to find the peak with singal processing toolbox.
2. /material provide an example the raw data of ultrasonic waves in 4-32V_002-ultrasonics data.csv. 4-32V_002.xlsx is the results of static results.
